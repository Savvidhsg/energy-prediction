This project explores how Machine Learning (ML) can assist engineers and architects in designing energy-efficient buildings. The focus is on predicting the Heating Load (HL) and Cooling Load (CL) of a building based on design parameters such as wall area, roof area, glazing area, and orientation.

The dataset used is simulated, making it a useful sandbox for experimenting with ML techniques and understanding how different design features influence energy consumption. This is a simplified approach that focuses on key parameters, providing a conceptual demonstration rather than a detailed engineering-grade simulation.

The workflow covers the full process: exploring and analyzing the data, training models, comparing their performance, and building an interactive Streamlit web app for quick predictions. Itâ€™s intended as a practical example of applying ML to a real-world-inspired engineering problem.
